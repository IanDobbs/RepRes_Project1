## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# locate and download the dataset
fileurl <-  "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileurl, destfile = "activity.zip")
unzip("activity.zip")
# read the data
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?

Note: ignoring the missing values in the dataset

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day (ignoring the missing values)

```{r}
# group by 'date' and sum 'steps' using dplyr
library(dplyr)
stepsum <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(sum_steps=sum(steps))
hist(stepsum$sum_steps)
```

2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps 

```{r}
# calculation with NA values stripped
mean(stepsum$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE)

median(stepsum$sum_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
# group by 'interval' and summarise by the average number of 'steps', averages across all days
ts <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(avg_steps=mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# plot the result in ggplot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ts, aes(x=interval, y=avg_steps)) +
        geom_line() +
        xlab("5-minute interval") +
        ylab("Average number of steps across all days") +
        labs(title = "Average daily activity pattern")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
# calculate the maximum number of steps
max(ts$avg_steps)

# calculate the interval that corresponds to the maximum number of steps
with(ts, interval[which.max(avg_steps)])
```
## Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

```{r}
# count the number of NAs in the dataset
sum(is.na(activity))
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

I have already calculated the mean for each 5-minute minute interval so I will use the result to impute the missing values.

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
# merge the mean for each 5-minute interval into the activity file and use coalesce to replace only the missing values and create a new dataset 'activity2' with the missing data filled in
activity2 <- activity %>% left_join(ts, by = "interval") %>%
        mutate(steps = coalesce(steps, avg_steps)) %>%
        select(-c(avg_steps))

# check there are no NAs remaining
summary(activity2)
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}
stepsum2 <- activity2 %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(sum_steps=sum(steps))

hist(stepsum2$sum_steps)

mean(stepsum2$sum_steps)

median(stepsum2$sum_steps)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
activity2 <- activity2 %>% mutate(day = weekdays(as.Date(date),
                                                 abbreviate = TRUE))
activity2$day  <- ifelse(activity2$day %in% c("Sat", "Sun"),
                         "weekend", "weekday") 
 
activity2$day <- as.factor(activity2$day)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

```{r}
# group by 'interval' and 'day' and summarise by the average number of 'steps', averages across all days
ts2 <- activity2 %>% group_by(interval, day) %>% summarise(avg_steps=mean(steps))

# plot the result in ggplot
ggplot(ts2, aes(x=interval, y=avg_steps)) +
        geom_line() +
        facet_wrap(. ~ day, ncol = 1) +
        xlab("5-minute interval") +
        ylab("Average number of steps across all days")
```
